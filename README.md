## Goals
* Provide seamless, user-friendly access to historical US government contract data.
* Empower users to explore and visualize awarded contract data across multiple dimensions.
* Enable trend analysis and detailed reporting for strategic planning.
* Ensure data is accurate, up-to-date, and easily exportable.
* Maintain high system availability, security, and compliance.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal of this capstone is to **build and present a working prototype of a software application, demonstrating the integration of Generative AI at every phase of the SDLC**. You will act as a full-stack developer, using AI as your co-pilot for planning, architecture, coding, testing, and documentation.
