## Contracting Visualization Software

The Contracting Visualization Software is an AI-powered, RESTful service application designed to empower contracting companies with deep insights into historical US government contract awards. The platform will provide an interactive dashboard with robust data exploration, visualization, and reporting capabilities, enabling users to analyze trends, drill into contract details, and make strategic, data-driven decisions.

## Vision
* To become the leading analytics and visualization platform for US government contract data, simplifying the discovery of actionable insights for contracting companies and leveling the playing field for market analysis and strategy.

## Goals
* Provide seamless, user-friendly access to historical US government contract data.
* Empower users to explore and visualize awarded contract data across multiple dimensions.
* Enable trend analysis and detailed reporting for strategic planning.
* Ensure data is accurate, up-to-date, and easily exportable.
* Maintain high system availability, security, and compliance.
