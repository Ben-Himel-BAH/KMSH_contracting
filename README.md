## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

The primary goal of this capstone is to **build and present a working prototype of a software application, demonstrating the integration of Generative AI at every phase of the SDLC**. You will act as a full-stack developer, using AI as your co-pilot for planning, architecture, coding, testing, and documentation.
