---

# ADR-002: ML Model Baseline

## Context

The AI component must power trend analysis and anomaly detection on historical contract data (see US5), with â‰¥98% accuracy.

## Decision

**Use scikit-learn (Python) for initial trend analysis and anomaly detection, with baseline models such as Linear Regression, ARIMA for time series, and Isolation Forest for anomalies.**

## Status

**Accepted**

## Consequences

- Models are explainable, lightweight, and easy to retrain on periodic data updates
- Compatible with FastAPI stack
- Production-ready and meets PRD accuracy requirements

## Justification

- scikit-learn is mature, well-documented, and widely used for classical ML tasks
- Initial trend analysis requires interpretable models (per Analyst persona and PRD)
- Supports rapid prototyping and future migration to advanced models

## Alternatives

- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Overkill for initial statistical trends; more useful for deep learning in later phases.
- **Facebook Prophet/XGBoost**: Possible upgrades if data/usage grows.

---

# ADR-003: Feature Engineering

## Context

Features must:
- Support filtering by date, NAICS, PSC, location, value (US2)
- Enable trend and anomaly detection (US5)
- Power keyword/company search (US7)

## Decision

**Engineer features including:**
- Date features (year, quarter, month, period-on-period change)
- NAICS/PSC categorical encoding
- Geographic encoding (state, region, latitude/longitude if available)
- Aggregated value/duration statistics
- TF-IDF vectors for contract description keyword search

## Status

**Accepted**

## Consequences

- Enables all required filtering and analytics
- Supports ML models for trend and anomaly detection
- Powers fast search and reporting

## Justification

- PRD requires fine-grained filtering, trend analytics, search, and reporting
- Geographic and categorical features directly support dashboard visualizations and analytics

## Alternatives

- **Deep learning feature extraction**: Not needed at initial scale/complexity

---

# ADR-004: Database

## Context

The system must:
- Store 10,000+ contracts (scalable)
- Support complex filters (date, NAICS, PSC, location, value)
- Enable fast search and aggregations
- Be secure, compliant, and cloud-ready

## Decision

**Use cloud-managed PostgreSQL (e.g., AWS RDS, Azure Database, GCP Cloud SQL) as the primary database.**

## Status

**Accepted**

## Consequences

- Relational model fits the contract data structure
- Supports full-text search (for US7), geospatial queries (for location filtering)
- Managed service provides encryption at rest, automated backups, scaling, and compliance

## Justification

- PRD calls for security, compliance, and scalability
- PostgreSQL supports all required features (JSON, PostGIS, full-text search)

## Alternatives

- **NoSQL (MongoDB)**: Less optimal for relational queries, compliance, and reporting.
- **On-premise DB**: Not in-scope for initial cloud-based deployment.

---

## Context

Per PRD, must meet:
- NIST, FISMA, federal guidelines
- RBAC, audit logging, encryption at rest/in transit
- Secure authentication (OAuth2.0/SSO)
- <2s response time, 99.5% uptime

## Decision

**Adopt the following security posture:**
- OAuth2.0 with JWT tokens for API authentication (integrate with Auth0 or Azure AD)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enforced in backend
- All data encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- Audit logs for all admin and data access actions
- Regular vulnerability scans, dependency checks, and security reviews

## Status

**Accepted**

## Consequences

- Meets all PRD compliance, security, and audit requirements
- Integrates with enterprise identity providers
- Scales to 500+ users securely

## Justification

- Mandated by PRD and necessary for government-related software

## Alternatives

- **Basic API key auth**: Insufficient for RBAC and compliance.
- **Custom auth**: Higher risk, less secure, not justified.

---

# ADR-006: Observability

## Context

PRD requirements:
- <2s response time
- 99.5% uptime
- Standardized error logging and user notification (US8)
- Audit for compliance

## Decision

**Implement observability stack:**
- Metrics: Prometheus (metrics collection), Grafana (dashboards)
- Application logging: Structured logs (JSON), shipped to cloud provider log service (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor)
- Error tracking: Sentry (captures stack traces, alerts)
- API tracing: OpenTelemetry/Jaeger for distributed tracing

## Status

**Accepted**

## Consequences

- Enables real-time monitoring and alerting
- Easy error root cause analysis and performance tuning
- Enables compliance/audit requirements

## Justification

- PRD mandates reliability, uptime, and auditability
- Standardized error schema for all API responses

## Alternatives

- **Manual log shipping/monitoring**: Less scalable, harder to maintain

---

# ADR-007: Model Transparency

## Context

PRD and personas (especially Analyst) require:
- Trust in AI-generated insights
- Model outputs must be explainable and auditable

## Decision

**Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and/or LIME for model interpretability.**

## Status

**Accepted**

## Consequences

- Users can see which features drive AI insights (trend, anomaly detection)
- Supports compliance with transparency and audit requirements

## Justification

- SHAP/LIME are industry standard for Python and scikit-learn
- Directly addresses user and regulatory needs

## Alternatives

- **Opaque deep learning models**: Not needed at this phase, would undermine transparency.

---

# ADR-008: Awards API Design

## Context

APIs must:
- Be RESTful, secure, and support all required queries/filters
- Return standardized JSON, with error schemas per PRD
- Support dashboard, search, reporting, and admin operations

## Decision

**Define primary API endpoints as:**

| Endpoint                        | Method | Description                                  | Auth           |
|----------------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `/dashboard`                     | GET    | Get summary KPIs for dashboard               | User           |
| `/contracts`                     | GET    | List/filter contracts (date, NAICS, etc.)    | User           |
| `/contracts/{id}`                | GET    | Get contract details by ID                   | User           |
| `/contracts?search={keywords}`   | GET    | Search contracts by company/keyword          | User           |
| `/visualizations/trends`         | GET    | Get trend data (for charts)                  | User           |
| `/reports/export?format=csv|pdf` | GET    | Export filtered report                       | User           |
| `/users`                         | POST   | Create user (admin only)                     | Admin          |
| `/users/{id}`                    | DELETE | Delete user (admin only)                     | Admin          |

- All endpoints return JSON; errors follow `{"error_code": "...", "message": "..."}` schema.
- 401/403 for unauthorized actions; 400 for bad input; 404 for not found; 500 for server errors.

## Status

**Accepted**

## Consequences

- Enables all required user stories and features
- Standardizes error handling and user/admin separation

## Justification

- Strict alignment with PRD user stories, acceptance criteria, and non-functional requirements

## Alternatives

- **GraphQL**: Not required per PRD; REST better matches current needs and persona skill levels.
