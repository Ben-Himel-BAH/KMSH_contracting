    "This initial block sets up our environment. It adds the project's root directory to the Python path, allowing us to import our custom `utils.py` script. We then initialize the connection to our Large Language Model (LLM).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Documentation:**\n",
    " - Product Requirements Document (PRD) generated from a high-level idea.\n",
    " - Architecture Decision Records (ADR) including auto-generated technical decisions with their justification\n",
    " - Architecture Document including auto-generated UML diagrams (e.g., Component or Sequence diagrams).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Selection:**\n",
    "Our `utils.py` script is configured to work with multiple AI providers. You can change the `model_name` parameter in the `setup_llm_client()` function to any of the models listed in the `RECOMMENDED_MODELS` dictionary in `utils.py`. For example, to use a Hugging Face model, you could change the line to: `client, model_name, api_provider = setup_llm_client(model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Helper Functions Used:**\n",
    "- `setup_llm_client()`: To configure the API client for our chosen LLM.\n",
    "- `get_completion()`: To send a prompt to the LLM and get a response.\n",
    "- `save_artifact()`: To save our generated requirements to a file."
